### TODO list 

- Add field `performance` into struct `linregr` as a filter to select high-or low-performance clusters: `linregr.status = "HP";"LP"`.

- Add output file reporting the options that were used to run the code, e.g. _number of significant clusters_, etc.

- Replace warning functions from class `SPEDisplay` with a unique
  function `msg = f(mainfilename)`.
